25 February 2015:
========================
- The up, bottom, right and view works in sphere data but not in plane data!
- Bottom, Right, and Left view are not yet programmed!
- Output addition: number of points

27 February 2015:
========================
- The vtkCamera->SetFocalPoint is actually set the center point of the rotation.
- some adjustment if the data is in [um] scale -> the magnitude of the data will be very big,
  so we need to adjust the "Plane" visualization to be able to fit "visually" to the point cloud
- Up, Bottom, Right, and Left view should be improved!!! 
  SOLVED: by determining the SetFocalPoint (center roattion in the centroid) and SetAzimuth (angle)
- Plane fitting visualization should be improved!!!
  SOLVED: by setting the SetOrigin (minX, minY, pz), SetPoint1 (minX, maxY, pz) and SetPoint2 (maxX, minY, pz)

7 March 2015
===============================	
- FINISHED: Modified icon
- FINISHED: Making and open new window from the main window (using non-modal mode) with pointer
- sometime an error occur but not clearly stated in the error message: usually a situation in which we are
  using a function but we do not declare the #include file (the header)
- to send data to other window, it is better to use the public: setFunction();
- PROBLEM: Numerical data can not be passed instead, VTK data is succesfully sent

13 March 2015
===============================		
- FINISHED: Uniform and Gaussian random number generator
- FINISHED: multivariate-normal random generator mvrnd()
- FINISHED: function to calculate variogram model errorSimulator()
- FINISHED: coding the caller for the error simulator
		Problem:  There is a lingking problem (conflict) when the function is inside the same class functionClass.h
					because this class has been included in mainwindow.h. the functionClass.obj has been created
		Solution: Make the error simulator in seperate class Simulator.h 
		          THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE SHOULD MAKE *.dll FILE, to avoid linking problem
- TO DO: Make point animation

23 March 2015
===============================	
- FINISHED: Coding for simulation point
- PROBLEM: delay() is not recognized, SOLVED: #include <windows.h>, function Sleep(unsign int)
- STRANGE ERROR!!!:
  when we open a file from progrum run from the IDE compilation, there is an error we can not open the file
  BUT, if we open the file from the generated EXE file, it is open??? WHY???
  I think the problem is the MATLAB lock the file, try to generate the file from other computer or with C++
  I tried to geenrate the file with different id of the file in MATLAB still does not work
  THE PROBELM could be while reading the number of points!!!, whent the "number of points" is 6 digit, it works,
  but, when the number of points is <6 digits, it does not work!!!.why!!!
  YES, THIS IS THE PROBLEM, BUT WHY????
- FUNCTION TEST: randn and randu (tested)
			     mvrnd??
			     errorSimulator???

  BUT, if we open the file from the generated EXE file, it is open??? WHY???

  YES, THIS IS THE PROBLEM, BUT WHY????
  THE PROBLEM OCCURS on ren->AddActor(ownDataActor);????
  it is mention in vtkRenderer documentation that TOO SMALL data there will be a problem!!!!
  SOLVED: VTK can not handle data <100000 points
  SOLUTION:
		if(num_of_points<100000){
			strips->InsertNextCell(100001);
		}
		else{
			strips->InsertNextCell(counterPoint+1);
		}
  	int iter;
		if(num_of_points<100000){
			for(iter=num_of_points;iter<=100000;iter++){
			//for(iter=counter;iter<=100000;iter++){
				points->InsertPoint(iter,point); //inserting the value of the last point
				strips->InsertCellPoint(iter);
				pointColor->InsertNextValue(point[2]*1000.0);
			}
		}
  
  THE Problemn is related to the clipping range
  
  ren->ResetCameraClippingRange();
  SOLVE the problem the data is not directly shown!!!
  OPTIONAL: we can hide/show actor with vtkActor.SetVisibility(true/false), to speed up the rendering
  
  VTK ALSO PROVIDE Random data generator
  #include <vtkMath.h>
  vtkMath::RandomSeed(time(NULL));
  double a = vtkMath::Gaussian(0.0,2.0);
  
  
- FUNCTION TEST: randn and randu (tested)
			     mvrnd(tested)
			     errorSimulator(tested)
  PROBLEM FOUND: The iteration to insert the error into the m_perturbed matrix. (SOLVED)
- SETTING PROPERTY:
  actor->GetProperty()->SetPointSize(10.0); //set point size, actually we set from the mapper or the polydata (dataset)
  actor->GetProperty()->SetColor(0,1,0); //gren color, actually we set from the mapper or the polydata (dataset)
- PROBLEM is on the point simulation!!!, it only works for one iteration only
try to make the mapper, actor, camera, locally??? -->still not work
can we make the animation on separate window???
Partially solved, with all global vtk variable, but only work until the second iteration
ALL data in each iteration are the same, that is why we can not see the simulation--> MAYBE the sleep() value is too small


26 March 2015
====================================
 - vtkIdType = int --> #include "vtkType.h"
 - vtkSTLProblem: the problem is the copy data from vtkSTLReader to vtkPolyData!
  1. sequence of object definition affect the error!!!
	
	vtkPolyData *STLPolyData=vtkPolyData::New();

	//Visualization Pipeline
	vtkSTLReader *STLModel= vtkSTLReader::New(); //Reader Source Object
	STLModel->SetFileName(fileName);

	//vtkPolyData *STLPolyData=vtkPolyData::New(); This should be before vtkSTLReader *STLModel= vtkSTLReader::New();!!!
	STLPolyData=STLModel->GetOutput();
  
  2. Sequence in deleting the object is also effect the error!!!
  
  we have to use:
  STLModel->SetOutput(STLPolyData);
  instead of
  STLPolyData=STLModel->GetOutput();

- NEXT PROBLEM: the data can not be read from vtkPolyData!!!
  the problme is the data are not returned from the vtkPolyData
  SOLVED: we have to update the object vtkObject->Update()!!!
  
  SOLUTION:
  
  vtkSTLReader *STLModel= vtkSTLReader::New(); //Reader Source Object
	STLModel->SetFileName(fileName);
	STLModel->Update(); //THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP

  vtkPolyData *STLPolyData=STLModel->GetOutput(); //do not allocate memory for vtkPolyData
  
  29 March 2015
====================================
- PROBLEM: the camera position is not updated when open the new file.
  SOLVED: because the maximum and minimum value are not yet reset, so the calculation of max and min value are not working
  
   3 April 2015
====================================
- TESTING: shoa small number of points separately.
  RESULST: The same problem, the visualization can not show points < 100000, maybe due to the clippibng range, but
   for STL file, eventhoug the number of points is <100000, it still works.
- START IMPLEMENTING STL GENERATION, but there is a run time error
  IF WE REMOVE the camera->Delete(), everything will be okay!!!! Why?
  SOLVED: We do not need to alloctae memory for the camera, just initialize as pointer without memory allocation
  
  THIS IS THE SOLUTION:
  vtkCamera *camera;//=vtkCamera::New();
  camera=ren->GetActiveCamera();
  //camera->Delete();
  
  IT IS DIFFERENT LIKE THIS (in this case we should allocate the memory since we want to define the property of the camera):
  vtkCamera *camera=vtkCamera::New();
	camera->SetFocalPoint((maxX+minX)/2,(maxY+minY)/2,(maxZ+minZ)/2);//origin of the rotation
	camera->SetPosition(0,0,length*2);
	camera->Azimuth(-90.0);	
	//camera->SetViewUp(0,1,0);	
	ren->SetActiveCamera(camera);	
	
	ren->AddActor(actor);	
	ren->ResetCameraClippingRange();
	ren->GetRenderWindow()->Render();	
		
	camera->Delete();
	
   5 April 2015
====================================
- BUILDING: Plane outlier filtering data
- BUILDING: function to show data
  SMALL PROBLEM: the color is not changed?
  try to re-render after removingallviewprops, but still the same problem
  SOLUTION:
  
  pointCloudMapper->ScalarVisibilityOff();
  
  reason:
  The colour in the actor’s property only takes effect if there is no scalar data available 
  to the actor’s mapper. By default, the mapper’s input scalar data colours the actor,
  and the actor’s colour is ignored. To ignore the scalar data, use the method ScalarVisibilityOff().
  becasue when we reset the vtkPolyData pointcloud, it only reset the data points (geometry), but not the scalar data (attribut)!!!
 
 
  2 May 2015
=============================================
- FINISHED: FINALLY, extracting data (points and cell) from vtkPolyData
            Now, Points and the Triangles (faces) can be extract and we can process is as we want.
  SOLUTION:
    //Filling the points
	for(vtkIdType i=0; i<STLPolyData->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++){
		double point[3];
		STLPolyData->GetPoint(i,point);
		mPoints(i,0)=point[0];
		mPoints(i,1)=point[1];
		mPoints(i,2)=point[2];				
	}	

	//Filling the cells	
	for(vtkIdType i=0; i<STLPolyData->GetNumberOfCells(); i++){		
		vtkSmartPointer<vtkIdList> cellPointIds =vtkSmartPointer<vtkIdList>::New();
		STLPolyData->GetCellPoints(i,cellPointIds);		
		vtkIdType *cellId;
		cellId=cellPointIds->GetPointer(0);//we should start from the 0 position
		mCells(i,0)=*(cellId);
		mCells(i,1)=*(cellId+1);
		mCells(i,2)=*(cellId+2);
	}

- TESTING: coding for croping poly data. 
	       clipping (croping): vtkClipPolyData
	       cutting (delete): vtkCutter
  PROBLEM: 1. after cutting, the points left too small, it seems we can not control the box size (implicit function box)
           2. The points is not showing???
           we should try by vtkIdFilter --> no need
  SOLUTION: only works for point cloud but not working to the STL!!!
            - maybe we have to set the normals of the data??? --> the data to clipped is not the STL data	
  
  SOLVED: 
  1. make separate data editing for STL and Point Cloud           
  2. Solution code for the cropping and deleting data:
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkCubeSource> cubeSource=vtkSmartPointer<vtkCubeSource>::New();
	double centerX, centerY, centerZ;
	centerX=(maxX+minX)/2;
	centerY=(maxY+minY)/2;
	centerZ=(maxZ+minZ)/2;
	cubeSource->SetCenter(centerX, centerY, centerZ);
	cubeSource->SetCenter(maxX, centerY, centerZ);
	cubeSource->SetXLength((maxX-minX)/2);
	cubeSource->SetYLength(maxY-minY);
	cubeSource->SetZLength(maxZ-minZ);
	//cubeSource->SetXLength(((maxX-minX)/2)*0.1);
	//cubeSource->SetYLength((maxY-minY)*0.1);
	//cubeSource->SetZLength((maxZ-minZ)*0.1);
	cubeSource->Update();

	//cretae the function to clipp (crop the data). Creating implicit function: a box, the size is taken from the cubeSource bounding box
	vtkSmartPointer<vtkBox> implicitCube=vtkSmartPointer<vtkBox>::New(); //This is the implicit equation to clipp the data set (polyData)
	implicitCube->SetBounds(cubeSource->GetOutput()->GetBounds());
	//implicitCube->SetXMax(((maxX-minX)/2),(maxY-minY),(maxZ-minZ));

	//vtkIdFilter
	//generate scalars or field data from point and cell ids
    //vtkIdFilter is a filter to that generates scalars or field data using cell and point ids. 
	//That is, the point attribute data scalars or field data are generated from the point ids,
	//and the cell attribute data scalars or field data are generated from the the cell ids.
	//vtkSmartPointer<vtkIdFilter> idFilter=vtkSmartPointer<vtkIdFilter>::New();
	//idFilter->SetInputConnection(pointCloud);

	//vtkPolyDataNormal
	vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyDataNormals> normals=vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyDataNormals>::New(); //local
	normals->SetInput(pointCloud); 

	//Clipping the polydata
	vtkSmartPointer<vtkClipPolyData> clipper = vtkSmartPointer<vtkClipPolyData>::New();
	clipper->SetClipFunction(implicitCube);
	//clipper->SetInput(pointCloud);
	clipper->SetInput(normals->GetOutput());
	clipper->InsideOutOn(); // to keep Data inside the implicit function
	clipper->InsideOutOff(); // to keep Data outside the implicit function
	clipper->Update();

	vtkPolyData *STLPolyData=clipper->GetOutput();
	
	NOTE: 1. one of the goal to calculate "normals" is to have scalar data on the vtkPolyData (Dataset) to be able to be processed.
	      2. one other option is by using vtkIdFilter --> create scalar for its point id and cell id
	
- FOR STL: take the point data and cell data (keep in matrix float and integer) as global data memort, then send this to show the STL
